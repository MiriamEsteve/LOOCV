<h1> Supperefficiency and LOOCV </h1>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>To facilitate installation on a personal computer, we recommend installing git (see: https://git-scm.com/downloads) and the Anaconda distribution (see: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). The steps to follow are based on these two installations.</p>

<b>Step1</b>. Open the Anaconda Prompt console, place it in the desired directory for installation and enter the instruction: 
```
git clone https://github.com/MiriamEsteve/LOOCV.git
```

<b>Step 2</b>. Place us in the folder created by EATpy, using "cd EATpy", and execute the instruction:
```
python setup.py install
```
